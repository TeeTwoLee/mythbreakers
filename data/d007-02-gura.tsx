  summary: <>{"Scout's pa was sacrificing old people in town to a supernatural cave in exchange for high-quality metal. Scout investigated a cave with a new doctor in town. They found that the cave connected to a well near her house. Underneath the well opening, they found a dead old lady who stayed at Scout's house recently. At this point, the cave demanded blood and started to eat Scout and the doctor, so the two make a narrow escape through the well. They find out Scout's parents have fled town."} <strong>{"Gura left town with her sister and the doctor on a Ford car, a Harvey motorbike, a +2 pickaxe, and a +1 shiv for Mythton."}</strong></>,
