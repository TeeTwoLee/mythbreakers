Scout was never taught to read past basic labels such as toxic, do not ingest, and her social skills are very lacking. Scout has ample rural survival skills, little to no knowledge of modern cityfolk skills aside from what she learned from outdated VHS and DVD tapes. Farm life for Scout has been rather lonely.
